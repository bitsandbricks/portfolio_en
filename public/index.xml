      <description>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been leveraging GitHub Pages for publishing. This works great, but for blogdown we&amp;rsquo;ll start using Netlify. Let&amp;rsquo;s start RIGHT NOW with a site we&amp;rsquo;ve already built and published.&#xA;Pre-requisites Pick either your postcards site, or your distill site from day 01. Refresh your memory- which repository was it again?</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Introducing Yourself Online workshop! We look forward to meeting you. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.&#xA;Set up RStudio Cloud Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. I recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). I want you to be able to work from your own laptop in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.</description>

      <title>URSA: A Tool to Guide Urban Planning with Satellite Data</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/ursa-a-tool-to-guide-urban-planning-with-satellite-data/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/project/ursa-a-tool-to-guide-urban-planning-with-satellite-data/</guid>
      <description>Open data, in general, and data obtained through satellite records, in particular, offer countless uses for urban planning.&#xA;These data not only revolutionize the ability to study our metropolitan areas but can also drive more informed and strategic decision-making for sustainable urban development. Yet, there remains a significant obstacle that limits access to these resources: technical complexity, which imposes the need for specialized personnel and equipment often beyond the reach of local management teams.</description>

      <title>MAIIA: Mapping of Informal Settlements based on Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:4321/project/maiia-mapping-of-informal-settlements-based-on-artificial-intelligence/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:4321/project/maiia-mapping-of-informal-settlements-based-on-artificial-intelligence/</guid>
      <description>MAIIA is an algorithm that enables automated mapping of informal urban settlements through the analysis of satellite images. To facilitate its implementation, it is distributed as a pre-configured operating system image (via Docker) and alternatively as a set of Python notebooks, providing scripts that can train a detection model and apply it to new images in just two steps.&#xA;I led the development of the MAIIA algorithms thanks to the support of the Housing and Urban Development Division of the Inter-American Development Bank.</description>

      <description>Presenting the methodology at the Urban-Environmental Strategies Congress in Mendoza, Argentina&#xA;In recent years, the severe social and environmental impact of illegal waste dumping sites has made them one of the most serious problems faced by cities in the Global South, in a context of scarce information available for decision-making.&#xA;With the support of the Bunge &amp;amp; Born Foundation, I led the development of a data-driven model combining neural network-based object detection and satellite images to help identify the location of dumping sites and track their evolution over time.</description>

      <description>UrbanPy is an open-source Python library that automates the entire workflow required to obtain geographic boundaries of a city, estimate its population, locate places of interest, and even calculate travel times through the local street network.&#xA;UrbanPy is particularly useful for estimating accessibility indices—i.e., where people live farthest away from key resources and services such as schools, hospitals, bus stops, places to buy food, and so on.&#xA;I prototyped the library and led its development, thanks to the support of the Inter-American Development Bank.</description>

      <description>In 2019 I designed a training program based on the requirements of the Capacity Development for Innovation Directorate of the Ministry of Modernization of Argentina.&#xA;The training consisted of three practice-focused seminars. An introductory one on data science, which taught programming principles and analytics using R, the language for data analysis and visualization. Building on the knowledge acquired in the initial course, two specialization seminars allowed for a deeper understanding in key areas: one focused on statistical analysis and machine learning, and the other on spatial information analysis and visualization.</description>

      <description>As a child, I was a fan of science and technology popularization books (but only if they had amazing illustrations, mind you). So, I was eager to make my contribution to the genre, on topics that are now central to my profession.&#xA;I wrote these two books imagining what I would want to know if I were a kid today:&#xA;Do You Want to Know&amp;hellip; What is Artificial Intelligence? and Do You Want to Know&amp;hellip; What is Big Data?</description>

      <description>This interdisciplinary project combined the analysis of billions of anonymized mobile phone call records with epidemiological, sociodemographic, and healthcare databases. This allowed us to accurately identify areas characterized by high contact of their inhabitants with areas where the Chagas disease is endemic, and which also record a high level of socioeconomic and healthcare vulnerability.&#xA;The key to the results is that they allow for the identification of urban or rural areas where it is a priority to take healthcare actions and, as they are outside the endemic zone of the disease, they may not be considered as focal points of attention.</description>

Health benefits associated with access have a greater effect among socioeconomically vulnerable populations.&#xA;In Argentina, improving access and evaluating the effects of public green spaces is challenging, particularly on a federal scale, due to a lack of official and comprehensive information regarding the quality, location, and extent of urban green areas.&#xA;The Environmental Conservation Fund aims to incentivize research and management projects that seek environmental conservation and sustainable development in the country.</description>

      <description>As a Research Fellow at the Bunge and Born Foundation, I helped develop the Index of Confidence and Access to Vaccines (ICAV). The index was designed to identify barriers that hinder access to vaccination, as well as changes in public confidence regarding the importance, safety, and efficacy of vaccines.&#xA;Since 2019, the Bunge and Born Foundation has been conducting the ICAV, a project to study and measure the causes of the wide gap between the optimal level of vaccination and the rates achieved in Argentina.</description>

      <description>GPE (short for &amp;ldquo;Geo-referenced Program Evaluation&amp;rdquo;) is a package of functions for the R programming language. It was designed to make life easier for those analyzing movement dynamics in urban contexts.&#xA;For example, to measure the impact of social programs where access metrics (distances and travel times, places visited, etc.) are of interest. I originally developed the set of functions that now make up GPE to assist the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Buenos Aires City Government in evaluating the City&amp;rsquo;s Cultural Pass Program, an initiative to encourage access to cultural offerings (music, film, literature, etc.</description>
