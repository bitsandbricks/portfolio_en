    I help NGOs, governments, and international agencies harness the power of analytical tools and emergent technologies to support the development of cities and regions. Previously, I worked in the private sector as a specialist in the design of large-scale computing architectures.

    I hold a Master of Science degree in Urban Informatics, a graduate degree in Regional and Urban Planning, and a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

    I have designed and taught quite a few courses on programming, data analysis and data visualization tailored for diverse audiences including architects, urban planners, sociologists and even legal professionals.
